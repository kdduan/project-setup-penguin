# Project Repository

## Project Description

Our product allows users to create fun Pokemon-inspired trading cards highlighting various salient traits about themselves such as thier superpowers, weaknessses, communication preferences and more. Each team will start with a "dek" of cards and team members will create profile cards to add to the deck. We envision that teammembers would be able to learn more about each other by looking at profiles in the "dek", and in turn build a strong foundation for future teamwork to grow on.

## Project History

This project was inspired by the intern project our team member Janet Huang did during her internship at Asana.
